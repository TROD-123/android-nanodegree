# Android Developer Nanodegree Projects
I am Teddy Rodriguez, a Grow With Google scholarship recipient in Udacity's Android Nanodegree program based in the Los Angeles area. Welcome to my little corner! Below showcases the projects I completed in the program, along with the wide range of skills I learned.

I've originally started the Nanodegree back in 2015, but stopped midway after entering a career in Market Research. After I got accepted into the scholarship program in January 2018, I resumed work on these projects to push for a career change as an Android developer.

I would like to complete my career transition by continuing to develop as a profession. If you're reading this and recruiting, I would love to offer my help and expertise to create Android apps that would help grow your company and satisfy your clients. Even though I'm in Los Angeles, I am open to relocating if need be so I can hone my skills. So let's chat! You can reach me via e-mail at cia.123trod@gmail.com

Thanks for looking through!

Teddy
