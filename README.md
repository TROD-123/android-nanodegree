# hi!
This is my collection of projects for Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree.

Currently contains:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Project 0: Nanodegree Portfolio<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Project 1: Poopular Movies, Stage 1

<b>Information about Project 1:</b> For this project, an API key is needed to retrieve information from the TMDB database. Information on how to get one <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api">here</a>. For security reasons, the API key used in this app has been removed from public distributions of this code. If you want to build this project and test it for yourself, please obtain an API key, store it in a string resource file in /res/values/, and name the string "movie_api_key".)
