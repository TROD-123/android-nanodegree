<em>XYZ Reader</em>, as what Udacity called it, is a mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos, headlines, and articles. It was originally an app that garnered many negative feedback about its interface. Reviewers described it as "odd", with "wonky" and "unreadable" text and a "sad" color scheme. My task was to bring the app to life by applying Material Design principles to address this feedback, while also fixing bugs that caused the app to crash for some users. Most of the app was already fully functional, so I while did not have to worry about building its implementation so much per se, but I did have to build upon the code that was provided to me. So this was also an exercise in itself - navigating through someone else's code.
<ul>
	<li>Creating a custom theme</li>
	<li>Using CoordinatorToolbarLayout and AppBarLayout to create collapsible toolbars</li>
	<li>More experience with CardView and FABs</li>
	<li>Parallax effects with image scrolling</li>
	<li>Continuous shared elements transitions with RecyclerView and ViewPager</li>
	<li>Using the Android Transitions and Animations framework for traversing fragments</li>
	<li>Parsing large amounts of text to make it readable without the additional spacing and line breaks provided in the source data</li>
</ul>
