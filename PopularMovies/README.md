The first app for Android with functionality that I've made, demonstrating many firsts, but most prominently my first interaction with open database API's and handling JSON data. This app provides users with current and up-to-date movie information as provided by The Movie Database (TMDB). This also includes links to trailers and reviews posted on the TMDB website. Users can display and sort movies according to popularity, ratings, recency, and upcoming. The app also enables users to favorite a movie and add it to their own favorites list for later display. Users can also share movies with their friends via text-message or e-mail. There is also offline functionality, leveraged through use of content providers, letting users access movie information already downloaded onto their device, even when their device has no network connection. <em>Popular Movies</em> also takes advantage of Android's concept of <em>Responsive Design</em> by providing different user interface layouts for different device sizes such as phones and tablets. For example, for tablets, a well-known 2 column master-detail layout is used, displaying the list of movies on the left column, and movie details on the right.
