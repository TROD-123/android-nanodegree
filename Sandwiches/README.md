# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Overview
A basic app that shows a list of sandwiches as well as different properties of each

## What this project involves
- Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON.
- Parses JSON objects through built-in utilities provided by org.json

## What I learned
- Parsing JSON to a model object
- Designing an activity layout
- Populating all fields in the layout, using Android Data Binding

## Project source
Project is sourced from Udacity's Android Nanodegree program. Here is the [Sandwich Club app starter code.](https://github.com/udacity/sandwich-club-starter-code)

Instructions:
Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements
display in a sensible way. Implement the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it
produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that you designed.
