        This book is intended for presenting the basic concepts of Finite Element Analysis applied
        to several engineering applications. Salient Features: 1. Covers several modules of
        elasticity, heat conduction, eigenvalue and fluid flow analysis which are necessary for a
        student of Mechanical Engineering. 2. Finite Element formulations have been presented using
        both global and natural coordinates. It is important for providing smooth transition form
        formulation in global coordinates to natural coordinates. 3. Special focus has been given to
        heat conduction problems and fluid flows which are not sufficiently discussed in other
        textbooks. 4. Important factors affecting the formulation have been included as
        Miscellaneous Topics. 5. Several examples have been worked out in order to highlight the
        applications of Finite Element Analysis. New to this Edition Apart from moderately revising
        the whole text three new chapters \"Dynamic Analysis\", \"Non-linear Analysis\", \"Bending
        of Thin Plates\", three appendices and short questions and answers have been added in the
        present edition to make it more useful.
