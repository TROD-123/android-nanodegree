# Super Duo Project
The "Super Duo" assignment involves taking two, already-built apps and turning them from a functional to a production-ready state. See below for details for each.

### Football Scores

<em>Football Scores</em> takes information hosted from http://football-data.org, an open database API created and maintained by Daniel Freitag, and provides users of up-to-date schedules and scores of European soccer games for each day. In the app, dates are currently limited to the current day, two days prior, and two days after, for a total of 5 days. Like <em>Popular Movies</em>, users can also share game information with their friends through messaging. Along with providing accessibility features such as content descriptions and RTL functionality, this app also demonstrates one of my first attempts at adhering to Google's <em>Material Design</em> practices. For navigation, this app displays my first exposure to working with tabs.
<ul>
	<li>Integration points and error case handling</li>
	<li>Network sync statuses through shared preferences</li>
	<li>Accessibility: Content descriptions and the Google Talk Back interface; Localization and RTL layouts</li>
	<li>Collection widgets</li>
	<li>Tab layouts</li>
	<li>Recycler views</li>
	<li>Swipe to refresh</li>
</ul>

### Alexandria (Books)

Also a part of the "Super Duo" assignment, <em>Alexandria</em> interacts with the Google Books API to provide users an opportunity to search for books information and save them into their own local library. To facilitate looking up information, this app also provides barcode scanning functionality so that users can easily scan the ISBN barcodes of their books to look up more information about their books. While <em>Football Scores</em> demonstrates my first use of tabs in an app, <em>Alexandria</em> uses a Navigation Drawer layout. This app also attempts to conform to <em>Material Design</em> standards.
<ul>
	<li>Navigation drawer layouts</li>
	<li>Search queries using cursors</li>
	<li>Coordinator layouts and FABs</li>
	<li>User settings through shared preferences</li>
</ul>
</p>
